## Open Questions/Issues

- How to implement a formal BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) model for senator reasoning?
- What strategies for multi-session memory would allow senators to learn over time?
- How to enhance coalition formation and political maneuvering dynamics?
- Should speeches by AI and player be evaluated differently?
- How to maintain performance with increased agent complexity?

- Created pytest.yml for running the test suite on multiple Python versions
- Added game-simulation.yml for non-interactive game testing
- Implemented new `simulate` CLI command with non-interactive mode
- Enhanced SenateSession with test mode support using deterministic behavior
- Added environment variable support (ROMAN_SENATE_TEST_MODE) for CI testing

[2025-04-15 00:10:00] - **Mock Provider and Flexible API Mode System**
