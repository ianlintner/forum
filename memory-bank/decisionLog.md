# Decision Log

## Key Design Decisions

[2025-04-13 18:25:07] - **AI Speech Generation Implementation**

**Decision:** Implement AI-generated debate speeches using OpenAI API with a robust fallback mechanism.

**Rationale:**
- Enhances immersion by providing authentic Roman-style speeches
- Creates more engaging gameplay with varied and contextual debates
- Fallback mechanism ensures game playability even when API is unavailable

**Implementation:**
- Added `generate_speech` function in `debate.py` that uses API with senator context
- Created templated fallback speech generation for offline play
- Implemented stance-based speech coloring for visual clarity

[2025-04-13 18:25:07] - **Detailed Voting Results Display**

**Decision:** Enhance voting display with detailed breakdown showing debate stance vs. final vote.

**Rationale:**
- Increases strategic depth by showing which senators can be swayed
- Provides feedback on the impact of debates on voting outcomes
- Creates more engaging and informative endgame statistics

**Implementation:**
- Added detailed voting breakdown table in `main.py`
- Implemented visual indicators for swayed senators
- Modified vote tallying to consider debate stance when determining votes
- Added color coding for different voting positions

---

[2025-04-13 18:25:07] - **Plain English Summaries**

**Decision:** Add plain English summaries explaining each senator's position during debates.

**Rationale:**
- Improves user understanding of complex political stances
- Bridges gap between Latin/formal speech and gameplay mechanics
- Provides clear information on senator motivations and likely votes

**Implementation:**
- Added `generate_position_summary` function in `debate.py`
- Created detailed summaries that explain faction motivations
- Used color coding and clear position tags (FOR/AGAINST/UNDECIDED)

---

[2025-04-13 21:26:40] - **Bug Identified in Logging System**

**Decision:** Document bug in logging_utils.py related to time tracking during vote processing.

**Rationale:**
- Bug causes TypeError during voting phase: `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'`
- Error occurs in log_response method when calculating elapsed time
- Despite errors, game continues functioning due to error handling

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the self.start_time initialization in logging_utils.py
- Add proper null checking before time arithmetic operations
- Consider using a default value when start_time is None
- Create more comprehensive error handling in the logging module

[2025-04-13 23:22:30] - **Implementation of Historically Accurate Roman Senate Flow**

**Decision:** Implement complete Roman Senate session flow following authentic historical procedures.

**Rationale:**
- Creates a more immersive and educational gameplay experience
- Follows the historically accurate sequence described in Roman sources
- Provides a complete game loop with all phases of Senate operations
- Addresses historical accuracy requirements in the game design

**Implementation:**
- Modified senate_session.py to handle the complete procedural flow
- Added opening ceremonies with religious observances and auspices
- Implemented attendance tracking and seating by rank
- Created formal introduction of agenda items (Relatio)
- Enhanced backroom political dealings between debates
- Added voting session with detailed results analysis
- Implemented formal session conclusion with adjournment speech

[2025-04-13 23:22:30] - **Bug Fixes for Game Flow Completion**

**Decision:** Implement defensive programming techniques to handle missing senator attributes.

**Rationale:**
- Missing senator traits and influence values were causing game-breaking errors
- Errors occurred during debate speech analysis and voting phases
- Defensive programming ensures game can continue even with incomplete data
- Maintains gameplay flow without critical failures

**Implementation:**
- Modified debate.py to safely access senator traits:
  ```python
  # Handle potential missing traits safely
  traits = senator.get("traits", {}) or {}
  
  # Get trait values with defaults if missing
  eloquence = traits.get("eloquence", 0.5)
  loyalty = traits.get("loyalty", 0.5)
  corruption = traits.get("corruption", 0.1)
  ```
- Modified senate_session.py to safely access senator influence:
  ```python
  # Create voting record with safe access to influence
  voting_record.append({
      "senator": senator["name"],
      "faction": senator["faction"],
      "vote": vote,
      "influence": senator.get("influence", 0.5),  # Default influence value if missing
      "debate_stance": debate_stance
  })
  ```
- Added inline comments explaining the defensive programming approach

[2025-04-14 20:18:00] - **Package Structure Reorganization**

**Decision:** Refactor the code from a flat module structure to a proper Python package organization.

**Rationale:**
- Improves maintainability by separating concerns into logical subpackages
- Enables proper package installation and distribution
- Makes the codebase more extensible and modular
- Follows Python best practices for package structure
- Simplifies imports and reduces circular dependencies

**Implementation:**
- Created src/roman_senate/ as the main package
- Organized functionality into subpackages: core, player, speech, debate, utils
- Updated import statements throughout the codebase
- Created proper package installation with pyproject.toml and setup.py
- Added command-line entry points in the cli.py module
- Maintained the original roman_senate_game/ module for backward compatibility
- Refactored file locations while preserving core functionality
