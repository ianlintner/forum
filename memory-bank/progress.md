# Project Progress Log

## Major Milestones

[2025-04-15 04:11:00] - **Senator Interjections System Implementation**
- Created comprehensive interjection system for more authentic Roman Senate debates:
  - Implemented 5 historically accurate interjection types (Acclamation, Objection, Procedural, Emotional, Collective)
  - Added probability-based interjection generation based on relationships and topic controversy
  - Created Latin and English versions of all interjections using the two-prompt approach
  - Enhanced debate display to include interjections at appropriate moments

- Added comprehensive error handling for LLM-generated content
- Enhanced topic display with proper formatting

[2025-04-15 02:16:54] - **Agent-Driven Architecture Implementation**
- Created autonomous senator agents with memory and goals
