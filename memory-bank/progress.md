## Ongoing Development

- Refining AI prompt engineering for more historically accurate speeches
- Exploring deeper personality traits for senators
- Considering game modes with different faction distributions
- Addressing bug in logging_utils.py related to time tracking
- Integrating player_manager.py with main game flow

## Current Issues

[2025-04-13 21:27:01] - **Bug in logging_utils.py Time Tracking**
- Identified TypeError: `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'` during voting phase
- Error occurs in log_response method when calculating elapsed time (time.time() - self.start_time)
- Issue appears when self.start_time is None but time calculation is attempted
- Game continues functioning despite errors due to exception handling
- Fix will require proper initialization or null checking of start_time variable

## Future Features Roadmap

- Historical events that influence debates

- Enhanced visual presentation with maps and senator portraits
- Save/load game functionality
- Dynamic senator relationships that evolve during gameplay
- Expand political maneuvering with more complex deal mechanics
- Add more detailed faction-specific objectives and victory conditions
- Player character progression with unlockable special abilities
- Senator career paths and historical impact tracking
