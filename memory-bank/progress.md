- Identified TypeError: `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'` during voting phase
- Error occurs in log_response method when calculating elapsed time (time.time() - self.start_time)
- Issue appears when self.start_time is None but time calculation is attempted
- Game continues functioning despite errors due to exception handling
