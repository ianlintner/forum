# Roman Senate Logging System

This directory contains log files generated by the Roman Senate application. The logging system is designed to provide comprehensive debug information for development and troubleshooting.

## Log File Format

Log files follow this naming convention:
- Standard logs: `run.YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log` (timestamped at application start)
- Custom logs: User-specified filename when using the `--log-file` option

## Log Entry Format

Each log entry has the following format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | LEVEL | module:line_number | message
```

For example:
```
2025-04-18 18:58:24 | INFO | root:100 | Roman Senate AI Game starting
```

## Log Levels

The system supports the following log levels, in order of increasing severity:
1. `DEBUG` - Detailed information for diagnosing problems
2. `INFO` - Confirmation that things are working as expected
3. `WARNING` - Indication of something unexpected
4. `ERROR` - Something failed, but the application can still function
5. `CRITICAL` - The application cannot continue to function

## How to Use Logging Options

The Roman Senate CLI supports several logging options:

### Global Logging Options
These options can be used with any command:

```bash
# Increase verbosity (sets level to DEBUG)
senate <command> --verbose

# Set a specific log level
senate <command> --log-level DEBUG

# Use a custom log file
senate <command> --log-file my_custom_log.log
```

### Examples

```bash
# Run a simulation with verbose logging
senate simulate --verbose

# Play a game with specific log level
senate play --log-level WARNING

# Save a game with custom log file
senate save --log-file game_saves.log
```

## Common Log Messages

- Application startup: "Roman Senate AI Game starting"
- Configuration details: "Using LLM Provider: X (Model: Y)"
- Game events: "Starting simulation: senators=X, debate_rounds=Y..."
- Error tracking: Full stack traces for any errors encountered

## Best Practices for Developers

When adding new features to the Roman Senate application:

1. Use the appropriate log level for your messages:
   - `DEBUG` for detailed information useful during development
   - `INFO` for normal operation messages
   - `WARNING` for unusual but recoverable situations
   - `ERROR` for failures that impact functionality
   - `CRITICAL` for critical failures

2. Include context in log messages:
   - What operation was being performed
   - Relevant parameter values
   - Clear error descriptions

3. Log entry and exit points of major functions:
   ```python
   logger.debug(f"Starting debate with {senator_count} senators")
   # ... function code ...
   logger.debug("Debate completed successfully")
   ```

4. Log performance-critical operations with timing information when appropriate:
   ```python
   import time
   start_time = time.time()
   # ... operation ...
   logger.debug(f"Operation completed in {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")
