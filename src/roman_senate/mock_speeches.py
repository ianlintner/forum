        "Populares": [
            "Citizens of Rome, I urge you to consider this military funding in light of who bears the burden. Our common citizens fill the ranks of Marius' legions, yet the wealthy avoid service through privilege. If we must expand our forces, let us also ensure that those who profit most from Rome's conquests contribute their fair share to our treasury.",
            "While I support strengthening our defenses, we must consider reforms that would allow the common people who serve in these legions to benefit from the land and wealth they help secure. The Populares have long advocated for veterans' colonies and land redistribution, which this expansion should include.",
            "I cannot fully support this measure without provisions to ensure that military service provides a path to citizenship and property for our loyal soldiers. The plebeian families who send their sons to fight deserve more than glory - they deserve security and opportunity."
        ],
        "Merchant": [
            "Esteemed colleagues, as a senator with substantial shipping interests, I strongly support funding Marius' legions. Secure trade routes require military protection, and the proposed allocation would ensure our merchants can conduct business without fear of disruption from northern tribes.",
            "The expansion of our legions represents an investment in Rome's economic future. Every denarius spent on military preparation now will return tenfold in secure commerce. My trading partners throughout the Mediterranean agree that the Cimbric threat must be addressed decisively.",
            "The markets respond favorably to decisive military action. This funding will not only protect our physical territories but will strengthen confidence in Roman commerce throughout the known world. The merchant class stands firmly behind this sensible allocation."
        ],
        "Military": [
            "Senators, having personally faced barbarian hordes in battle, I can attest to the urgent necessity of this funding. The Cimbri and Teutones represent an existential threat to our northern territories. Marius' military reforms require proper funding to be effective against such numerous enemies.",
            "The glory of Rome depends on the strength of her legions. I have studied reports from our northern provinces, and the troop numbers proposed by Marius are the minimum required to ensure victory. This is not extravagance - it is necessity for our survival.",
            "This allocation demonstrates Rome's commitment to security. I have personally inspected our northern defenses and found them insufficient against the coming storm. Either we properly fund our legions now, or we pay a far higher price in Roman blood later."

    "religious_matters": {
        "Populares": [
            "While I respect our religious traditions, I question whether lavish temple expenditures serve the gods better than caring for their people. Would Jupiter himself not prefer that we use these funds to feed hungry Romans rather than gild his altar? Let us honor the gods through justice for all citizens.",
            "The gods smile upon Rome when Rome cares for all her citizens. Before we allocate vast sums to temple construction, let us ensure the plebeians have bread and shelter. A prosperous, unified Rome is the greatest offering we can make to the immortal gods.",
            "Religious observance is indeed important, but the Populares believe that the gods judge us by how we treat the least among us. Let us balance our devotion to the gods with pragmatic concerns for those who struggle daily in the shadow of these grand temples."
        ],
        "Merchant": [
            "Colleagues, as a practical matter, religious festivals and grand temples bring visitors and commerce to Rome. This proposal represents not just spiritual investment but economic opportunity. Merchants from my province strongly support religious works that enhance Rome's prestige.",
            "The proposed temple restoration would require marble from my quarries and materials transported by our shipping companies. Beyond the spiritual benefits, this project would employ hundreds of craftsmen and stimulate trade throughout the republic.",
            "Religious harmony creates stable markets. When the gods are properly honored, the people feel secure, and commerce flourishes. This investment in our religious infrastructure is simultaneously an investment in Rome's economic well-being."
        ],
        "Military": [
            "Jupiter Optimus Maximus has guided our legions to victory countless times. This temple expansion demonstrates to our enemies that Rome enjoys divine favor. As a military man, I recognize that spiritual confidence is as important as sharp swords on the battlefield.",
            "I have seen soldiers fight with supernatural courage when they believe the gods favor their cause. This temple restoration is not mere decoration - it is a strategic reinforcement of Roman morale as we face dangerous enemies on multiple frontiers.",
            "Before every successful campaign I have led, proper sacrifices were made to ensure divine favor. Rome's military might is inseparable from her piety. This temple expansion properly acknowledges the divine support that makes our legions invincible."
