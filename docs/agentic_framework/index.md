## Introduction

Welcome to the Agentic Game Framework documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the framework's architecture, usage, and migration process.

The Agentic Game Framework is a flexible, extensible system for building agent-based game simulations across multiple domains. It provides a foundation for creating complex, interactive agent systems with sophisticated event processing, memory systems, and relationship tracking.

## Documentation Overview

The framework documentation is organized into several main sections:

- Cross-Domain Integration

## Core Systems

The framework is built around several core systems:

### Event System

The Event System is the backbone of the architecture, enabling communication between agents and components through event-based messaging.

### Agent System

The Agent System manages the creation, lifecycle, and processing of agents, providing a framework for creating different types of agents with consistent interfaces.

### Memory System

The Memory System handles storage and retrieval of agent memories and experiences, allowing agents to remember past events and learn from experiences.

### Relationship System

The Relationship System tracks and manages relationships between agents, modeling social connections and dynamics.

## Architecture Modes

The framework supports multiple architectural modes:

- **Legacy Mode** - Uses the original architecture for backward compatibility
- **New Mode** - Uses the new event-driven architecture for new development
- **Hybrid Mode** - Runs both architectures in parallel for migration and comparison
