## Introduction

This migration guide provides a comprehensive approach for migrating existing agent-based systems to the Agentic Game Framework. It outlines a step-by-step strategy, details the Roman Senate migration as a case study, and addresses common migration patterns and challenges.

The Agentic Game Framework was designed with migration in mind, providing clear extension points and a flexible architecture that can accommodate a wide range of existing systems. This guide will help you understand how to leverage these features to migrate your system efficiently.

## Migration Strategy

Migrating to the Agentic Game Framework involves several phases, each with specific goals and activities.

### Assessment Phase

The first step in migration is to assess your existing system and identify how it maps to the Agentic Game Framework architecture.

1. **Identify Core Components**:
   - Identify the main components of your existing system
   - Determine how they map to the framework's core systems (Event, Agent, Memory, Relationship)
   - Identify any components that don't have a clear mapping

2. **Analyze Communication Patterns**:
   - Identify how components communicate in your existing system
   - Determine how these patterns can be mapped to the event-driven architecture
   - Identify any synchronous communication that needs to be converted to asynchronous

3. **Evaluate State Management**:
   - Identify how state is managed in your existing system
   - Determine how this maps to the framework's agent state and memory systems
   - Identify any global state that needs to be distributed

4. **Assess Domain-Specific Logic**:
   - Identify domain-specific logic in your existing system
   - Determine how this can be implemented using the framework's extension points
   - Identify any custom components that need to be created

### Planning Phase

Once you've assessed your existing system, you can plan the migration process.

1. **Define Migration Scope**:
   - Determine which components to migrate first
   - Identify any components that can be migrated incrementally
   - Define the end state of the migration

2. **Create Component Mapping**:
   - Map each component in your existing system to a component in the framework
   - Identify any gaps that require custom components
   - Document the mapping for reference during implementation

3. **Design Domain Extensions**:
   - Design domain-specific extensions for the framework
   - Define custom event types, agent types, relationship types, and memory types
   - Implement extension points for domain-specific behavior

4. **Plan Testing Strategy**:
   - Define how to test the migrated system
   - Create test cases that verify equivalent behavior
   - Plan for performance testing and comparison

### Implementation Phase

With a solid plan in place, you can begin implementing the migration.

1. **Set Up Framework**:
   - Install and configure the Agentic Game Framework
   - Set up the development environment
   - Create the basic structure for your domain implementation

2. **Implement Domain Extensions**:
   - Create custom event types for your domain
   - Implement custom agent types with domain-specific behavior
   - Define custom relationship types for your domain
   - Create custom memory types for domain-specific information

3. **Migrate Core Logic**:
   - Convert existing communication to event-based communication
   - Implement agent behavior based on existing logic
   - Migrate state management to the agent state and memory systems
   - Implement relationship logic based on existing interactions

4. **Implement Adapters**:
   - Create adapters for external systems that can't be migrated
   - Implement event converters for cross-domain communication
   - Create bridges for legacy components that need to interact with the new system

### Testing Phase

After implementation, thorough testing is essential to ensure the migrated system behaves correctly.

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify that custom components behave as expected
   - Test event handling and generation

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify that events flow correctly through the system
   - Test cross-domain communication

3. **System Testing**:
   - Test the entire system end-to-end
   - Verify that the migrated system behaves the same as the original
   - Test performance and scalability

4. **Regression Testing**:
   - Ensure that existing functionality still works
   - Verify that the migration hasn't introduced new bugs
   - Test edge cases and error handling

### Deployment Phase

Once testing is complete, you can deploy the migrated system.

1. **Plan Deployment Strategy**:
   - Determine whether to deploy all at once or incrementally
   - Plan for data migration if necessary
   - Schedule deployment during low-usage periods

2. **Deploy Framework Components**:
   - Deploy the core framework components
   - Configure the framework for your environment
   - Set up monitoring and logging

3. **Deploy Domain Implementation**:
   - Deploy your domain-specific components
   - Configure domain-specific settings
   - Initialize the system with initial data

4. **Monitor and Optimize**:
   - Monitor the system for issues
   - Optimize performance based on real-world usage
   - Address any issues that arise

## Completed Migration Phases

As of this version, we have successfully completed the first five phases of the migration plan for the Roman Senate simulation. These phases form a solid foundation for a complete migration to the new architecture.

### Phase 1: Core Event System

The Core Event System implementation established the foundation for the event-driven architecture, including:

- **Base Event Classes**: Created abstract base class for all events
- **Event Bus**: Implemented event publishing and subscription mechanisms
- **Event Filtering**: Added support for filtering events by type, source, and other criteria
- **Event Batching**: Implemented batch processing for improved performance

```python
# Example of a custom event in the new system
from agentic_game_framework.events.base import BaseEvent

class SpeechEvent(BaseEvent):
    def __init__(self, senator_id, topic, content, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(
            event_type="senate.speech",
            source=senator_id,
            data={
                "topic": topic,
                "content": content
            },
            **kwargs
        )
```

### Phase 2: Agent System

The Agent System implementation provides a flexible framework for creating and managing agents:

- **Abstract Agent Interface**: Created a common interface for all agents
- **Event-Driven Senators**: Reimplemented senators as event-driven agents
- **Agent Factory**: Added factory pattern for creating different types of agents
- **Agent Manager**: Implemented centralized agent management

```python
# Example of a senator agent in the new system
from agentic_game_framework.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent

class SenatorAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, name, faction, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(agent_id=f"senator_{name.lower()}", **kwargs)
        self.name = name
        self.faction = faction
        self.subscribe_to_event("senate.speech")
        self.subscribe_to_event("senate.debate")
        
    def process_event(self, event):
        if event.event_type == "senate.speech":
            # Process speech event
            return self._generate_reaction(event)
```

### Phase 3: Memory & Relationship Systems

The Memory and Relationship Systems provide sophisticated mechanisms for tracking information and social connections:

- **Memory Interface**: Created a standard interface for memory management
- **Memory Types**: Implemented different types of memories (event, episodic, semantic)
- **Memory Manager**: Added centralized memory storage and retrieval
- **Relationship Types**: Created abstractions for different relationship types
- **Relationship Manager**: Implemented centralized relationship tracking

```python
# Example of memory creation from an event
from agentic_game_framework.memory.memory_interface import MemoryItem

class SpeechMemory(MemoryItem):
    def __init__(self, speech_event, importance=0.5, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(importance=importance, **kwargs)
        self.speaker_id = speech_event.source
        self.topic = speech_event.data.get("topic")
        self.content = speech_event.data.get("content")
        self.timestamp = speech_event.timestamp
```

### Phase 4: Integration Layer

The Integration Layer enables interoperability between the old and new architectures:

- **Architecture Bridges**: Created bridges between the old and new systems
- **Event Converters**: Implemented tools to convert between old messages and new events
- **Legacy Adapters**: Added adapters to wrap legacy components for use in the new system
- **Dual-Mode Operation**: Implemented the ability to run in either or both architectures

```python
# Example of an architecture bridge
from agentic_game_framework.integration.bridges import ArchitectureBridge

class SenateSessionBridge(ArchitectureBridge):
    def __init__(self, event_bus, legacy_session_manager):
        self.event_bus = event_bus
        self.legacy_session_manager = legacy_session_manager
        self.event_bus.subscribe("senate.session.start", self.handle_session_start)
        self.event_bus.subscribe("senate.session.end", self.handle_session_end)
        
    def handle_session_start(self, event):
        # Convert event to legacy format and call legacy method
        self.legacy_session_manager.start_session(
            date=event.data.get("date"),
            topic=event.data.get("topic")
        )
```

### Phase 5: CLI & Interface Adaptation

The CLI and Interface Adaptation provides user interface tools for controlling the system:

- **Command-Line Interface**: Reimplemented the CLI with flags for selecting architecture mode
- **Configuration System**: Added flexible configuration for framework settings
- **Mode Selection**: Implemented the ability to select between legacy, new, or hybrid mode
- **Reporting Tools**: Created tools for monitoring system behavior and performance

```bash
# Example CLI usage with mode selection
$ python run_senate.py --mode=new --agents=50 --topic="Land Reform"

# Running in hybrid mode (both architectures)
$ python run_senate.py --mode=hybrid --compare-output
```

## Roman Senate Migration

The Roman Senate simulation serves as a case study for migrating to the Agentic Game Framework. This section details the migration process and provides specific examples.

### Component Mapping

The Roman Senate simulation was mapped to the framework as follows:

| Roman Senate Component | Framework Component |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Senator | BaseAgent |
| Debate | BaseEvent |
| Vote | BaseEvent |
| Speech | BaseEvent |
| Faction | Agent Attribute |
| Relationship | BaseRelationship |
| Memory | MemoryItem |
| Event Memory | EventMemoryItem |

### Event System Migration

The event system migration involved converting the existing communication mechanisms to event-based communication:

1. **Identify Event Types**:
   - Debate events
   - Vote events
   - Speech events
   - Relationship events

2. **Create Custom Events**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.events.base import BaseEvent
   
   class DebateEvent(BaseEvent):
       def __init__(
           self,
           source: str,
           topic: str,
           position: str,
           arguments: list,
           **kwargs
       ):
           data = {
               "topic": topic,
               "position": position,
               "arguments": arguments
           }
           
           super().__init__(
               event_type="debate",
               source=source,
               target=None,
               data=data,
               **kwargs
           )
   ```

3. **Convert Communication**:
   - Replace direct method calls with event publishing
   - Subscribe agents to relevant event types
   - Implement event handlers in agents

### Agent System Migration

The agent system migration involved converting senators to framework agents:

1. **Create Senator Agent**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent
   
   class SenatorAgent(BaseAgent):
       def __init__(
           self,
           name: str,
           faction: str,
           attributes: dict = None,
           agent_id: str = None,
           initial_state: dict = None
       ):
           # Set up senator-specific attributes
           senator_attributes = attributes or {}
           senator_attributes.update({
               "agent_type": "senator",
               "faction": faction
           })
           
           # Set up initial state
           senator_state = initial_state or {}
           senator_state.update({
               "senate": {
                   "reputation": 50,
                   "influence": 30,
                   "speaking_skill": 40
               }
           })
           
           super().__init__(
               agent_id=agent_id or f"senator_{name.lower()}",
               name=name,
               attributes=senator_attributes,
               initial_state=senator_state
           )
           
           # Subscribe to relevant event types
           self.subscribe_to_event("debate")
           self.subscribe_to_event("vote")
           self.subscribe_to_event("speech")
   ```

2. **Implement Event Handling**:
   ```python
   def process_event(self, event: BaseEvent) -> Optional[BaseEvent]:
       if event.event_type == "debate":
           return self._process_debate_event(event)
       elif event.event_type == "vote":
           return self._process_vote_event(event)
       elif event.event_type == "speech":
           return self._process_speech_event(event)
       
       return None
   ```

3. **Implement Decision Making**:
   ```python
   def generate_action(self) -> Optional[BaseEvent]:
       # Check current state to determine action
       state = self.get_state()
       
       if state.get("active_debate"):
           # Generate speech or vote event based on state
           return self._generate_speech_event()
       
       return None
   ```

### Memory System Migration

The memory system migration involved implementing a memorization system for agents:

1. **Define Memory Types**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.memory.memory_interface import MemoryItem
   
   class SpeechMemory(MemoryItem):
       def __init__(
           self,
           memory_id: str,
           timestamp: float,
           event: BaseEvent,
           importance: float = 0.5
       ):
           super().__init__(
               memory_id=memory_id,
               timestamp=timestamp,
               importance=importance
           )
           
           self.speaker_id = event.source
           self.topic = event.data.get("topic")
           self.content = event.data.get("content")
           self.event_id = event.get_id()
   ```

2. **Create Memory Manager**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.memory.memory_interface import MemoryInterface
   
   class SenatorMemoryManager(MemoryInterface):
       def __init__(self, agent_id: str, max_memories: int = 100):
           self.agent_id = agent_id
           self.memories = {}
           self.max_memories = max_memories
           
       def add_memory(self, memory: MemoryItem) -> None:
           self.memories[memory.memory_id] = memory
           
           # Prune memories if we exceed the maximum
           if len(self.memories) > self.max_memories:
               self._prune_memories()
   ```

3. **Integrate with Event System**:
   ```python
   def create_memory_from_event(self, event: BaseEvent) -> Optional[MemoryItem]:
       if event.event_type == "speech":
           return SpeechMemory(
               memory_id=f"speech_{str(uuid.uuid4())}",
               timestamp=time.time(),
               event=event,
               importance=0.7 if event.target == self.agent_id else 0.4
           )
       
       return None
   ```

### Relationship System Migration

The relationship system migration involved implementing a relationship tracking system:

1. **Define Relationship Types**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.relationships.base_relationship import BaseRelationship
   
   class PoliticalRelationship(BaseRelationship):
       def __init__(
           self,
           agent_a_id: str,
           agent_b_id: str,
           initial_strength: float = 0.0,
           relationship_id: str = None
       ):
           super().__init__(
               agent_a_id=agent_a_id,
               agent_b_id=agent_b_id,
               relationship_type="political",
               initial_strength=initial_strength,
               relationship_id=relationship_id
           )
           
           # Set up political-specific attributes
           self.attributes.update({
               "trust": 0.5,
               "respect": 0.5,
               "agreement": 0.5
           })
   ```

2. **Create Relationship Manager**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.relationships.relationship_manager import RelationshipManager
   
   class SenateRelationshipManager(RelationshipManager):
       def __init__(self, event_bus):
           super().__init__(event_bus)
           
           # Subscribe to relationship-affecting events
           self.event_bus.subscribe("speech", self._handle_speech_event)
           self.event_bus.subscribe("vote", self._handle_vote_event)
   ```

3. **Implement Relationship Dynamics**:
   ```python
   def update_relationship_from_event(self, event: BaseEvent) -> None:
       if event.event_type == "speech":
           speaker_id = event.source
           topic = event.data.get("topic")
           position = event.data.get("position")
           
           # Update relationships between speaker and other agents
           for relationship in self.get_relationships_for_agent(speaker_id):
               other_agent_id = relationship.get_other_agent_id(speaker_id)
               
               # Calculate agreement factor based on agent positions
               agreement_factor = self._calculate_agreement(other_agent_id, position, topic)
               
               # Update relationship strength
               relationship.update_strength(agreement_factor * 0.1)
               
               # Update relationship attributes
               relationship.update_attribute("agreement", agreement_factor * 0.05)
   ```

## Migration Patterns

These patterns represent common approaches for migrating specific aspects of a system to the Agentic Game Framework.

### Event-Based Communication

Converting direct method calls to event-based communication:

1. **Identify Communication Patterns**:
   - Look for direct method calls between components
   - Identify the data being passed
   - Determine the directional flow of information

2. **Define Event Types**:
   - Create event types for each type of communication
   - Define the data structure for each event type
   - Establish event priorities based on importance

3. **Replace Method Calls with Events**:
   ```python
   # Before: Direct method call
   def deliver_speech(self, topic, content):
       for senator in self.senators:
           senator.hear_speech(self.id, topic, content)
   
   # After: Event-based communication
   def deliver_speech(self, topic, content):
       speech_event = SpeechEvent(
           source=self.id,
           topic=topic,
           content=content
       )
       self.event_bus.publish(speech_event)
   ```

4. **Implement Event Handlers**:
   ```python
   def process_event(self, event):
       if event.event_type == "speech":
           speaker_id = event.source
           topic = event.data.get("topic")
           content = event.data.get("content")
           
           # Process the speech
           self._process_speech(speaker_id, topic, content)
   ```

### Agent Abstraction

Converting domain-specific entities to framework agents:

1. **Identify Entity Characteristics**:
   - Determine the core attributes and state of each entity
   - Identify behavior patterns and decision-making logic
   - Map relationships with other entities

2. **Create Agent Classes**:
   - Define a base agent class for common behavior
   - Create specialized agent classes for domain-specific behavior
   - Implement domain-specific decision making

3. **Implement Event Processing**:
   ```python
   def process_event(self, event):
       # Common event processing logic
       self.memory_manager.create_memory_from_event(event)
       
       # Domain-specific event processing
       if hasattr(self, f"_process_{event.event_type}_event"):
           processing_method = getattr(self, f"_process_{event.event_type}_event")
           return processing_method(event)
       
       return None
   ```

4. **Implement Action Generation**:
   ```python
   def generate_action(self):
       # Get current state
       state = self.get_state()
       
       # Domain-specific action generation
       if state.get("current_role") == "speaker":
           return self._generate_speech_action()
       elif state.get("current_role") == "voter":
           return self._generate_vote_action()
       
       return None
   ```

### Memory Management

Implementing memory systems for agents:

1. **Identify Information to Remember**:
   - Determine what information agents need to remember
   - Classify information by type and importance
   - Define how memories decay over time

2. **Create Memory Types**:
   - Define base memory structure
   - Create specialized memory types for domain-specific information
   - Implement memory importance and decay

3. **Implement Memory Storage and Retrieval**:
   ```python
   def retrieve_memories(self, query):
       # Filter memories based on query
       matching_memories = []
       
       for memory in self.memories.values():
           if memory.matches_query(query):
               matching_memories.append(memory)
       
       # Sort by relevance (combination of importance and recency)
       matching_memories.sort(
           key=lambda m: m.importance * (1.0 / (1.0 + time.time() - m.timestamp)),
           reverse=True
       )
       
       return matching_memories[:query.get("limit", 10)]
   ```

4. **Create Memories from Events**:
   ```python
   def create_memory_from_event(self, event):
       # Create memory based on event type
       if event.event_type == "speech":
           return SpeechMemory(
               memory_id=f"speech_{str(uuid.uuid4())}",
               timestamp=time.time(),
               event=event,
               importance=self._calculate_importance(event)
           )
       
       return None
   ```

### Relationship Modeling

Implementing relationship systems for agents:

1. **Identify Relationship Types**:
   - Determine the types of relationships between agents
   - Define attributes for each relationship type
   - Determine how relationships change over time

2. **Create Relationship Classes**:
   - Define base relationship structure
   - Create specialized relationship classes for domain-specific relationships
   - Implement relationship dynamics

3. **Track Relationship Changes**:
   ```python
   def update_relationship_from_event(self, event):
       # Identify agents involved
       source_id = event.source
       target_id = event.target
       
       # Get their relationship
       relationship = self.get_relationship(source_id, target_id)
       
       if relationship:
           # Update relationship based on event type
           if event.event_type == "speech":
               agreement_factor = self._calculate_agreement(event)
               relationship.update_strength(agreement_factor * 0.1)
               relationship.update_attribute("respect", 0.05)
   ```

4. **Use Relationships in Decision Making**:
   ```python
   def decide_vote(self, topic, proposer_id):
       # Get relationship with proposer
       relationship = self.relationship_manager.get_relationship(self.id, proposer_id)
       
       # Base decision on relationship and topic alignment
       if relationship and relationship.get_strength() > 0.7:
           # Vote with ally
           return "support"
       elif self._calculate_topic_alignment(topic) > 0.8:
           # Vote based on topic alignment
           return "support"
       
       return "oppose"
   ```

### Dual-Mode Operation

Implementing the ability to run in both legacy and new architectures:

1. **Create Architecture Bridges**:
   - Implement bridges between old and new components
   - Define data conversion methods
   - Establish communication channels

2. **Implement Mode Selection**:
   ```python
   def run_simulation(self, mode="new"):
       if mode == "legacy":
           return self._run_legacy_simulation()
       elif mode == "new":
           return self._run_new_simulation()
       elif mode == "hybrid":
           return self._run_hybrid_simulation()
       else:
           raise ValueError(f"Unknown mode: {mode}")
   ```

3. **Create Event Translators**:
   ```python
   def translate_legacy_message(self, message):
       if message["type"] == "speech":
           return SpeechEvent(
               source=message["sender"],
               topic=message["topic"],
               content=message["content"]
           )
       
       return None
   ```

4. **Build Compatibility Layers**:
   ```python
   class LegacyCompatibilityLayer:
       def __init__(self, event_bus):
           self.event_bus = event_bus
           
           # Subscribe to new events to convert to legacy format
           self.event_bus.subscribe("speech", self._handle_speech_event)
           
       def _handle_speech_event(self, event):
           # Convert to legacy format
           legacy_message = {
               "type": "speech",
               "sender": event.source,
               "topic": event.data.get("topic"),
               "content": event.data.get("content")
           }
           
           # Call legacy handlers
           for handler in self.legacy_handlers:
               handler(legacy_message)
   ```
