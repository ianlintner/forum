## Introduction

This migration guide provides a comprehensive approach for migrating existing agent-based systems to the Agentic Game Framework. It outlines a step-by-step strategy, details the Roman Senate migration as a case study, and addresses common migration patterns and challenges.

The Agentic Game Framework was designed with migration in mind, providing clear extension points and a flexible architecture that can accommodate a wide range of existing systems. This guide will help you understand how to leverage these features to migrate your system efficiently.

## Migration Strategy

Migrating to the Agentic Game Framework involves several phases, each with specific goals and activities.

### Assessment Phase

The first step in migration is to assess your existing system and identify how it maps to the Agentic Game Framework architecture.

1. **Identify Core Components**:
   - Identify the main components of your existing system
   - Determine how they map to the framework's core systems (Event, Agent, Memory, Relationship)
   - Identify any components that don't have a clear mapping

2. **Analyze Communication Patterns**:
   - Identify how components communicate in your existing system
   - Determine how these patterns can be mapped to the event-driven architecture
   - Identify any synchronous communication that needs to be converted to asynchronous

3. **Evaluate State Management**:
   - Identify how state is managed in your existing system
   - Determine how this maps to the framework's agent state and memory systems
   - Identify any global state that needs to be distributed

4. **Assess Domain-Specific Logic**:
   - Identify domain-specific logic in your existing system
   - Determine how this can be implemented using the framework's extension points
   - Identify any custom components that need to be created

### Planning Phase

Once you've assessed your existing system, you can plan the migration process.

1. **Define Migration Scope**:
   - Determine which components to migrate first
   - Identify any components that can be migrated incrementally
   - Define the end state of the migration

2. **Create Component Mapping**:
   - Map each component in your existing system to a component in the framework
   - Identify any gaps that require custom components
   - Document the mapping for reference during implementation

3. **Design Domain Extensions**:
   - Design domain-specific extensions for the framework
   - Define custom event types, agent types, relationship types, and memory types
   - Implement extension points for domain-specific behavior

4. **Plan Testing Strategy**:
   - Define how to test the migrated system
   - Create test cases that verify equivalent behavior
   - Plan for performance testing and comparison

### Implementation Phase

With a solid plan in place, you can begin implementing the migration.

1. **Set Up Framework**:
   - Install and configure the Agentic Game Framework
   - Set up the development environment
   - Create the basic structure for your domain implementation

2. **Implement Domain Extensions**:
   - Create custom event types for your domain
   - Implement custom agent types with domain-specific behavior
   - Define custom relationship types for your domain
   - Create custom memory types for domain-specific information

3. **Migrate Core Logic**:
   - Convert existing communication to event-based communication
   - Implement agent behavior based on existing logic
   - Migrate state management to the agent state and memory systems
   - Implement relationship logic based on existing interactions

4. **Implement Adapters**:
   - Create adapters for external systems that can't be migrated
   - Implement event converters for cross-domain communication
   - Create bridges for legacy components that need to interact with the new system

### Testing Phase

After implementation, thorough testing is essential to ensure the migrated system behaves correctly.

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify that custom components behave as expected
   - Test event handling and generation

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify that events flow correctly through the system
   - Test cross-domain communication

3. **System Testing**:
   - Test the entire system end-to-end
   - Verify that the migrated system behaves the same as the original
   - Test performance and scalability

4. **Regression Testing**:
   - Ensure that existing functionality still works
   - Verify that the migration hasn't introduced new bugs
   - Test edge cases and error handling

### Deployment Phase

Once testing is complete, you can deploy the migrated system.

1. **Plan Deployment Strategy**:
   - Determine whether to deploy all at once or incrementally
   - Plan for data migration if necessary
   - Schedule deployment during low-usage periods

2. **Deploy Framework Components**:
   - Deploy the core framework components
   - Configure the framework for your environment
   - Set up monitoring and logging

3. **Deploy Domain Implementation**:
   - Deploy your domain-specific components
   - Configure domain-specific settings
   - Initialize the system with initial data

4. **Monitor and Optimize**:
   - Monitor the system for issues
   - Optimize performance based on real-world usage
   - Address any issues that arise

## Roman Senate Migration

The Roman Senate simulation serves as a case study for migrating to the Agentic Game Framework. This section details the migration process and provides specific examples.

### Component Mapping

The Roman Senate simulation was mapped to the framework as follows:

| Roman Senate Component | Framework Component |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Senator | BaseAgent |
| Debate | BaseEvent |
| Vote | BaseEvent |
| Speech | BaseEvent |
| Faction | Agent Attribute |
| Relationship | BaseRelationship |
| Memory | MemoryItem |
| Event Memory | EventMemoryItem |

### Event System Migration

The event system migration involved converting the existing communication mechanisms to event-based communication:

1. **Identify Event Types**:
   - Debate events
   - Vote events
   - Speech events
   - Relationship events

2. **Create Custom Events**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.events.base import BaseEvent
   
   class DebateEvent(BaseEvent):
       def __init__(
           self,
           source: str,
           topic: str,
           position: str,
           arguments: list,
           **kwargs
       ):
           data = {
               "topic": topic,
               "position": position,
               "arguments": arguments
           }
           
           super().__init__(
               event_type="debate",
               source=source,
               target=None,
               data=data,
               **kwargs
           )
   ```

3. **Convert Communication**:
   - Replace direct method calls with event publishing
   - Subscribe agents to relevant event types
   - Implement event handlers in agents

### Agent System Migration

The agent system migration involved converting senators to framework agents:

1. **Create Senator Agent**:
   ```python
   from agentic_game_framework.agents.base_agent import BaseAgent
   
   class SenatorAgent(BaseAgent):
       def __init__(
           self,
           name: str,
           faction: str,
           attributes: dict = None,
           agent_id: str = None,
           initial_state: dict = None
       ):
           # Set up senator-specific attributes
           senator_attributes = attributes or {}
           senator_attributes.update({
               "agent_type": "senator",
               "faction": faction
           })
           
           # Set up initial state
           senator_state = initial_state or {}
           senator_state.update({
               "senate": {
                   "reputation": 50,
                   "influence": 50,
                   "positions": {}
               }
           })
           
           super().__init__(
               name=name,
               attributes=senator_attributes,
               agent_id=agent_id,
               initial_state=senator_state
           )
           
           # Subscribe to relevant event types
           self.subscribe_to_event("debate")
           self.subscribe_to_event("vote")
           self.subscribe_to_event("speech")
       
       def process_event(self, event: BaseEvent) -> None:
           # Implementation based on existing logic
           pass
       
       def generate_action(self) -> BaseEvent:
           # Implementation based on existing logic
           pass
   ```

2. **Migrate Decision Logic**:
   - Convert existing decision-making logic to the `generate_action` method

       def __init__(
           self,
           memory_id: str,
           timestamp: float,
           event: BaseEvent,
           importance: float = 0.7,
           associations: dict = None
       ):
           super().__init__(
               memory_id=memory_id,
               timestamp=timestamp,
               event=event,
               importance=importance,
               associations=associations or {}
           )
           
           # Extract debate-specific data
           self.debate_data = self._extract_debate_data(event)
           
           # Add debate-specific associations
           self.add_association("memory_type", "debate")
           self.add_association("topic", self.debate_data["topic"])
           self.add_association("position", self.debate_data["position"])
       
       def _extract_debate_data(self, event: BaseEvent) -> dict:
           # Implementation
           pass
       
       def get_summary(self) -> str:

               strength=strength,
               attributes=attributes or {},
               relationship_id=relationship_id
           )
           
           # Initialize political-specific attributes
           self.attributes.setdefault("agreement_count", 0)
           self.attributes.setdefault("disagreement_count", 0)
           self.attributes.setdefault("last_interaction", None)
       
       def update(self, event: BaseEvent) -> bool:
           # Implementation based on existing logic
           pass
   ```

## Migration Challenges

This section addresses common challenges that may arise during migration.

### Architectural Differences

Differences in architecture can pose challenges:

1. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**:
   - The framework uses asynchronous event-based communication
   - Existing systems may use synchronous method calls
   - Solution: Convert synchronous calls to event publishing and handling

2. **Centralized vs. Distributed State**:
   - The framework uses distributed state in agents
   - Existing systems may use centralized state
   - Solution: Distribute state among agents and use events for coordination

3. **Object-Oriented vs. Component-Based**:
   - The framework uses a component-based approach
   - Existing systems may use a traditional object-oriented approach
   - Solution: Decompose objects into components and use composition

### Data Migration

Migrating existing data can be challenging:

1. **State Conversion**:
   - Convert existing state to agent state and memory
   - Ensure that all necessary information is preserved
   - Solution: Create a mapping between old and new state structures

2. **Relationship Conversion**:
   - Convert existing relationships to framework relationships
   - Ensure that relationship history is preserved
   - Solution: Create a mapping between old and new relationship structures

3. **Event History**:
   - Convert existing event logs to framework events
   - Ensure that event history is preserved
   - Solution: Create a mapping between old and new event structures

### Performance Considerations

Performance can be affected during migration:

1. **Event Processing Overhead**:
   - Event-based communication can introduce overhead
   - Solution: Use event batching and filtering to reduce overhead

2. **Memory Usage**:
   - Storing memories for many agents can increase memory usage
   - Solution: Implement memory pruning and importance-based retention

3. **Relationship Matrix Size**:
   - Storing relationships between many agents can lead to a large matrix
   - Solution: Use sparse relationship storage and relationship pruning

## Post-Migration Optimization

After migration, optimization can improve performance and maintainability:

1. **Event Optimization**:
   - Use event filtering to reduce unnecessary processing
   - Implement event batching for better performance
   - Use event prioritization for critical events

2. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Implement memory consolidation to reduce storage
   - Use memory importance to prioritize retrieval
   - Implement memory pruning to remove less important memories

3. **Relationship Optimization**:
   - Use sparse relationship storage for large agent populations
   - Implement relationship pruning to remove weak relationships
   - Use relationship caching for frequently accessed relationships

4. **Agent Optimization**:
   - Implement agent pooling for better resource usage
   - Use agent scheduling to distribute processing load
   - Implement lazy initialization for agent components
