## Key Features

The Roman Senate Event System provides:

1. **Real-time Reactions**: Senators can react to speeches as they happen
2. **Dynamic Interruptions**: Higher-ranking senators can interrupt speakers
3. **Position Changes**: Senators can be persuaded to change their stance on topics
4. **Memory of Events**: Senators remember events, reactions, and interactions
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging of all events for debugging and analysis
6. **Relationship Development**: Senators develop relationships based on interactions
7. **Faction Dynamics**: Faction alignments influence reactions and interruptions

## System Architecture

The event system is built around a central EventBus that connects all components:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    EB[EventBus] <--> DM[DebateManager]
    EB <--> SA1[Senator Agent 1]
    EB <--> SA2[Senator Agent 2]
    EB <--> SA3[Senator Agent 3]
    EB <--> RM[RelationshipManager]
    
    DM -- "1. Start Debate" --> EB
    SA1 -- "2. Generate Speech" --> DM
    DM -- "3. Publish Speech" --> EB
    EB -- "4. Notify of Speech" --> SA2
    EB -- "4. Notify of Speech" --> SA3
    EB -- "4. Notify of Speech" --> RM
    SA2 -- "5. React to Speech" --> EB
    SA3 -- "6. Interject" --> EB
    EB -- "7. Notify of Interjection" --> DM
    DM -- "8. Handle Interjection" --> SA1
    RM -- "9. Update Relationships" --> EB
    EB -- "10. Notify of Relationship Change" --> SA1
    EB -- "10. Notify of Relationship Change" --> SA2
    EB -- "10. Notify of Relationship Change" --> SA3
```

## Event Types

The system includes several core event types:

```mermaid

    Event <|-- DebateEvent
    Event <|-- SpeechEvent
    Event <|-- ReactionEvent
    Event <|-- InterjectionEvent
    Event <|-- VoteEvent
    Event <|-- RelationshipChangeEvent
    
    class Event {
        +String eventId
        +String eventType
        +DateTime timestamp
        +Any source
        +Map metadata
    }
    
    class DebateEvent {
        +String TYPE = "debate_event"
        +DebateEventType debate_event_type
        +String topic
    }
    
    class SpeechEvent {
        +String TYPE = "speech_event"
        +Dict speaker
        +String topic
        +String latin_content
        +String english_content
        +String stance
    }
    
    class ReactionEvent {
        +String TYPE = "reaction_event"
        +Dict reactor
        +String target_event_id
        +String content
        +String reaction_type
    }
    
    class InterjectionEvent {
        +String TYPE = "interjection_event"
        +Dict interjector
        +Dict target_speaker
        +InterjectionType interjection_type
        +String latin_content
        +String english_content
    }
    
    class VoteEvent {
        +String TYPE = "vote_event"
        +String proposal
        +Dict votes
    }
    
    class RelationshipChangeEvent {
        +String TYPE = "relationship_change"
        +String senator_id
        +String target_senator_id
        +String relationship_type
        +Float old_value
        +Float new_value
        +Float change_value

## Recent Enhancements

The event system has recently undergone several major enhancements:

1. **CLI Import Fix**: Resolved relative import issues in cli.py
2. **Comprehensive Logging System**: Added robust file and console logging
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implemented a publisher-subscriber system
4. **Testing Framework**: Created comprehensive tests for the new event system
5. **Relationship System Integration**: Added relationship events and handlers

## Getting Started

To quickly see the event system in action:

```bash
# Run the event system demo
python -m src.roman_senate.examples.event_system_demo

# Run the relationship system demo
python -m src.roman_senate.examples.enhanced_relationship_demo

# Run a full simulation with verbose logging
python -m src.roman_senate.cli simulate --verbose

# Run a debate with specific logging level
python -m src.roman_senate.cli play --log-level DEBUG

# Run a simulation with custom log file
python -m src.roman_senate.cli simulate --log-file my_simulation.log

# Run a simulation with specific event types enabled
python -m src.roman_senate.cli simulate --enable-reactions --enable-interruptions
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is the event system?**  
A: The event system is an event-driven architecture that enables senators to observe, listen to, and react to events in their environment, particularly during debates.

**Q: How does the event system improve the simulation?**  
A: It creates a more realistic and immersive simulation by enabling dynamic interactions between senators, including real-time reactions, interruptions, and position changes.

**Q: What are the main components of the event system?**  
A: The main components are the EventBus, Event classes, EventDrivenSenatorAgent, DebateManager, EventMemory, and RelationshipManager.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I create a new event type?**  
A: Extend the base Event class and define a unique TYPE class variable. See [Creating New Event Types](extending_events.md#creating-new-event-types).

**Q: How do I subscribe to events?**  
A: Use the EventBus.subscribe method, providing the event type and a handler function or object. See [Working with Events](developer_guide.md#working-with-events).

**Q: How do I optimize event handling for performance?**  
A: See the [Performance Optimization](extending_events.md#performance-optimization) section for techniques like batch processing, caching, and selective processing.

**Q: How do I integrate existing code with the event system?**  
A: See the [Integration Guide](integration_guide.md) for strategies like using compatibility layers, adapters, and feature flags.

**Q: How does the relationship system interact with the event system?**  
A: The relationship system subscribes to events like speeches, votes, and reactions, and updates relationships accordingly. It also publishes RelationshipChangeEvent when relationships change. See [Relationship System Integration](integration_guide.md#case-study-3-relationship-system-integration).
