## Introduction

The Roman Senate was one of history's most influential political bodies, functioning for over 800 years and establishing traditions that still influence modern legislative bodies. This document explores the fascinating traditions, protocols, and peculiarities of the Roman Senate that have been incorporated into the Roman Senate Game.

## Senate Procedures

### Meeting Schedule

Unlike modern legislatures with regular schedules, the Roman Senate:

- Could only meet on **dies comitialis** (days when public assemblies could legally gather)
- Was prohibited from meeting on **dies nefasti** (days considered religiously inauspicious)
- Usually began meetings at dawn and had to conclude by sunset
- Primarily met in the **Curia Hostilia** (later the Curia Julia), though could meet in any **templum** (consecrated space)

> **Game Implementation:** Our Senate Session module respects these time restrictions. You may notice debates automatically concluding if they run too long, simulating the setting sun!

### Session Opening

Each Senate session began with:

1. **Taking of Auspices** - Religious officials (augurs) would interpret signs from the gods to determine if the meeting was favorable
2. **Animal Sacrifice** - Usually a white bull or ox for major sessions
3. **Seating by Rank** - Senators arranged themselves by status, with former consuls (consulares) in the most prominent positions
4. **Roll Call** - The presiding magistrate would call the roll, though attendance wasn't mandatory

> **Historical Insight:** Senators who failed to attend important sessions could be fined, though this penalty was rarely enforced. Some senators would send slaves ahead to reserve their preferred seats!

## Speaking Protocols

### Speaking Order

1. **Princeps Senatus** (First Man of the Senate) spoke first
2. **Consuls-elect** spoke next, if any were present
3. **Former consuls** (consulares) in order of seniority
4. **Former praetors** (praetorii) in order of seniority
5. **Former aediles, tribunes, and quaestors**
6. **Pedarii** (senators who had not yet held magistracies) rarely spoke

> **Game Implementation:** In simulation mode, our speech ordering algorithm respects this traditional hierarchy, with higher-ranking senators speaking earlier in debates.

### Speaking Rules

- A senator could speak for as long as he wished (no time limits!)
- Senators stood to speak from their assigned place
- Interrupting a speaker was considered highly improper but did occur
- Speakers could be shouted down or applauded based on the Senate's mood
- The phrases "*Patres conscripti*" (Conscript Fathers) or "*Quirites*" were used to address the assembly

> **Fun Fact:** Cato the Younger was famous for filibustering by speaking until sunset to prevent votes on matters he opposed. Julius Caesar once had Cato arrested mid-speech for this tactic!

## Voting Methods

The Senate primarily used three voting methods:

### Pedibus Ire In Sententiam (Voting With Their Feet)

The most common voting method:
1. The presiding magistrate would call "Who is of this opinion, pass to this side"
2. Senators would physically move to stand on one side of the chamber or the other
3. Each side would be counted
4. No abstentions were permitted - senators had to choose a side

### Voice Vote

For less controversial matters:
1. The presiding magistrate would ask "Who approves, say 'aye'"
2. Then "Who disapproves, say 'no'"
3. The louder response determined the outcome

### Per Singulos (Roll Call)

For the most important decisions:
1. Each senator's name was called in order of rank
2. Each announced their vote and could add brief comments
3. This method provided a clear record of individual positions

> **Game Implementation:** The Voting System in the Roman Senate Game primarily uses the Per Singulos method so players can see how each senator votes, influenced by speeches and relationships.

## Senate Politics

### Factional Alignment

While not formal political parties, Roman senators generally aligned with one of two approaches:

#### Optimates ("The Best Men")
- Conservative faction supporting the aristocracy's power
- Emphasized tradition and senatorial authority
- Notable members: Cato the Younger, Cicero, Brutus

#### Populares ("Favoring the People")
- Advocated for reforms benefiting common citizens
- Used popular assemblies to bypass Senate resistance
- Notable members: Julius Caesar, Gaius Gracchus, Clodius

> **Political Insight:** Many senators switched between these positions based on political expediency. Family ties, business interests, and patronage networks often mattered more than ideological alignment.

### Clientela (Patronage System)

The Senate operated on a complex web of patronage:
- Powerful senators (patrons) protected less influential ones (clients)
- Clients supported their patrons' policies in return
- These relationships often transcended factional boundaries
- Some influential families could control dozens of client senators

## Curious Traditions

### Clothing and Status

- Senators wore the **toga praetexta** (white toga with a purple border)
- They wore distinctive red leather shoes called **calcei**
- A gold ring indicated senatorial rank
- During mourning periods, senators would wear plain togas and refrain from cutting their hair and beards

### Strange Superstitions

- If a session was interrupted by a senator having a seizure (considered a bad omen), the meeting was immediately adjourned
- Thunder or lightning caused immediate adjournment
- A presiding official could cancel a meeting by claiming to "see bad omens" in the sky
- If a rat ran across the Senate floor, the session would be considered inauspicious

> **Historical Oddity:** Senate meetings could be canceled if the liver of a sacrificial animal showed unusual features. Political opponents would sometimes bribe the soothsayers to find "problems" with the sacrifice!

## Notable Senate Moments

### The Catilinarian Conspiracy (63 BCE)

When Cicero exposed a plot to overthrow the Republic, he delivered his famous Catilinarian Orations to the Senate. After the fourth speech, the Senate voted to execute the conspirators without trial, setting a controversial precedent.

> **Oratorical Achievement:** Cicero's first oration against Catiline began with the famous line: "*Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?*" ("How long, Catiline, will you abuse our patience?")

### Caesar's Assassination (44 BCE)

The most infamous Senate session occurred on the Ides of March (March 15) when Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times by a group of senators. He reportedly fell at the foot of a statue of Pompey, his former ally and rival.

> **Last Words Dispute:** While Shakespeare immortalized "*Et tu, Brute?*" ("You too, Brutus?") as Caesar's last words, ancient historians suggest he either said nothing or spoke in Greek, saying "*καὶ σύ, τέκνον;*" ("You too, my child?")

### Caligula's Horse (39 CE)

Emperor Caligula allegedly threatened to make his horse, Incitatus, a consul and senator. While modern historians doubt he actually did this, he did build the horse a marble stable, ivory manger, and appointed servants to the animal.
