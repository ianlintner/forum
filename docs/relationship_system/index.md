## Key Features

The Senator Relationship System provides:

1. **Multi-dimensional Relationships**: Different types of relationships (political, personal, mentor/mentee, rivalry, family)
2. **Persistent Storage**: Relationship data stored in the memory system
3. **Event-driven Updates**: Relationships change in response to events
4. **Relationship Decay**: Natural erosion of relationships over time
5. **Decision Influence**: Relationships affect senator decision-making
6. **Rich Context**: Historical context for relationship values
7. **Visualization Tools**: Tools for visualizing relationship networks

## System Architecture

The relationship system is built around the `RelationshipManager` that connects all components:

## Getting Started

To quickly see the relationship system in action:

```bash
# Run the basic relationship system demo
python -m src.roman_senate.examples.relationship_system_demo

# Run the enhanced relationship demo
python -m src.roman_senate.examples.enhanced_relationship_demo

# Run a full simulation with relationship logging
python -m src.roman_senate.cli simulate --log-relationships
```

For a quick introduction to the system, see the [User Guide](user_guide.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is the relationship system?**  
A: The relationship system is a framework for modeling complex relationships between senators, influencing their decision-making, and evolving these relationships over time.

**Q: How does the relationship system improve the simulation?**  
A: It creates a more realistic and immersive simulation by enabling dynamic interactions between senators, including relationship-influenced decisions, natural relationship decay, and persistent relationship data.

**Q: What are the main components of the relationship system?**  
A: The main components are the RelationshipMemoryItem, RelationshipChangeEvent, RelationshipManager, and RelationshipAwareSenatorAgent.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do I add a new relationship type?**  
A: Extend the `RELATIONSHIP_TYPES` list in `RelationshipManager` and add a decay rate for the new type. See [Adding New Relationship Types](developer_guide.md#adding-new-relationship-types).

**Q: How do I customize how relationships influence decisions?**  
A: Override the `decide_stance` method in `RelationshipAwareSenatorAgent`. See [Enhancing Decision Influence](developer_guide.md#enhancing-decision-influence).

**Q: How do I integrate with the relationship system?**  
A: See the [Integration Guide](integration_guide.md) for strategies like using event handlers, memory queries, and relationship-aware components.

**Q: How do I visualize relationships?**  
A: Use the visualization tools provided in the relationship system, such as the network graph and relationship matrix. See [Visualizing Relationships](user_guide.md#visualizing-relationships).
