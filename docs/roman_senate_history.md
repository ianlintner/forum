## Introduction

The Roman Senate was one of the most enduring institutions of ancient Rome, spanning over a thousand years from the city's legendary founding to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Beginning as an advisory council to the early Roman kings, it evolved into a powerful governing body in the Republic, before transforming again under the Emperors. The Roman Senate Game primarily focuses on the Late Republic period (133-27 BCE), a time of intense political conflict, constitutional crises, and dramatic speeches that changed the course of history.

As the Latin word "*senatus*" derives from "*senex*" meaning "old man," the Senate embodied the wisdom and experience of Rome's most respected elder statesmen. This document provides historical context for the Roman Senate Game, exploring the institution's evolution, powers, and cultural significance.

## Founding and Monarchy (753-509 BCE)

According to Roman legend, Romulus established the Senate shortly after founding Rome in 753 BCE. He selected 100 men from the city's leading families to serve as his advisors, called "*patres*" (fathers). This council expanded to 300 members during the monarchy.

During this period:
- The Senate's role was purely advisory to the king
- Membership was limited to patrician families
- The king selected senators personally
- The Senate could not enact laws, but provided counsel

> **Legendary Origin:** After Romulus disappeared during a thunderstorm, the Senate claimed he had ascended to godhood as Quirinus. Some historians suggest that senators may have assassinated him and invented this divine ascension to cover their actions! This demonstrates the Senate's early political maneuvering.

## Early Republic (509-287 BCE)

After the overthrow of the last Roman king, Tarquinius Superbus, in 509 BCE, the Senate's power increased dramatically. Without a monarch, the Senate became the chief governing authority, though it shared power with elected officials (consuls) and popular assemblies.

Key developments:
- The Senate's advice (*senatus consultum*) became increasingly binding in practice
- Senators were initially all patricians, creating class tension
- The Senate controlled public finances and foreign policy
- The **Conflict of the Orders** led to greater plebeian rights
- The **Lex Ovinia** (318 BCE) transferred the power to choose senators from consuls to censors

> **Political Insight:** Censors reviewed the list of senators every five years, and could expel senators for "moral failings." This power was often used politically to remove opponents, showing that morality charges in Roman politics (as today) were frequently political weapons.

## Middle Republic (287-133 BCE)

This period is considered the Senate's golden age. Following the Lex Hortensia of 287 BCE, which gave plebeian assemblies greater power, the Senate adapted by developing an unwritten constitution that balanced patrician and plebeian interests.

During this period:
- The Senate directed Rome's expansion throughout Italy and the Mediterranean
- Governed provinces through pro-magistrates
- Controlled state finances and religious affairs
- Maintained foreign policy, including declaring war and ratifying treaties
- Former elected officials automatically entered the Senate after their term

> **Senate Size:** By 200 BCE, the Senate had 300 members. Most senators rarely spoke during debates, with a small core of influential figures dominating discussions. In the Roman Senate Game, we model this by having certain high-influence senators speak more frequently.

## Late Republic (133-27 BCE)

The period featured in the Roman Senate Game was marked by increasing political violence, territorial expansion, and eventually civil war. The Senate faced challenges from populist reformers, ambitious generals, and changing social conditions.

### The Gracchi Brothers (133-121 BCE)

Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus attempted land reform using the people's assembly, bypassing senatorial authority:
- Tiberius Gracchus was killed by senators in 133 BCE - the first political murder in Rome in centuries
- Gaius Gracchus met a similar fate in 121 BCE
- Their deaths set a precedent for political violence

### Marian Reforms and Sulla's Dictatorship (107-78 BCE)

- Gaius Marius reformed the army, creating loyal soldiers dependent on their generals rather than the state
- Sulla marched on Rome (a shocking taboo) in 88 BCE and again in 82 BCE
- As dictator, Sulla doubled the Senate to 600 members and strengthened its power
- He reduced the power of tribunes and established senatorial control of courts

### Caesar and the First Triumvirate (60-44 BCE)

- Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus formed an unofficial power-sharing arrangement
- The Senate was increasingly sidelined
- After civil war, Caesar became dictator perpetuo (dictator for life)
- He expanded the Senate to 900 members, diluting its prestige
- His assassination in 44 BCE was led by senators claiming to restore the Republic

### Octavian and the Second Triumvirate (43-27 BCE)

- Octavian (later Augustus), Mark Antony, and Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate
- Another civil war led to Octavian's victory at Actium (31 BCE)
- The Republic effectively ended, though the Senate continued to exist

> **Cicero's Observation:** "The Senate has fallen into such low repute that when we take our seats, people passing by laugh at us because there are so few of us." - Cicero, during Caesar's dictatorship, lamenting how the institution had been undermined.

## Imperial Senate (27 BCE-476 CE)

When Augustus became Rome's first emperor in 27 BCE, he reformed the Senate:
- Reduced membership back to 600
- Set a property qualification of 1,000,000 sesterces
- Created new patrician families
- Removed "unworthy" members

Under the Empire, the Senate's powers were largely ceremonial:
- The emperor selected new senators and presided over meetings
- The Senate became a status symbol rather than a governing body
- It remained responsible for governing specific provinces
- Continued to issue decrees, but typically at the emperor's direction
- Formally ratified the succession of new emperors

> **Caligula's Horse:** Emperor Caligula allegedly threatened to make his horse, Incitatus, a consul and senator. While this story is likely exaggerated, it demonstrates how imperial power had reduced the once-mighty Senate to a body that could be mocked by emperors.

## Senate Buildings

### Curia Hostilia (c. 600-52 BCE)

The original Senate house, attributed to King Tullus Hostilius:
- Located at the north end of the Forum Romanum
- Relatively small, rectangular building
- Rebuilt several times after fires and damage
- Destroyed by fire during Clodius's funeral riot in 52 BCE

### Curia Julia (44 BCE-present)

Julius Caesar began construction of a new Senate house, completed by Augustus:
- Still stands today (restored) in Rome
- Seated approximately 300-500 senators
- Arranged with benches on either side
- Presiding magistrate seated on a raised platform
- Simple interior emphasizing austere Republican values

> **Seating Arrangements:** Senators were seated by rank, with former consuls (consulares) in the front rows. The prestige of speaking early in debates made these positions influential. Junior senators often never spoke at all, simply moving to one side of the chamber during voting.

## Influential Senators

### Cato the Elder (234-149 BCE)

Known for ending every speech with "*Carthago delenda est*" ("Carthage must be destroyed"):
- Rose from non-noble background to become a leading senator
- Embodied traditional Roman values of simplicity and discipline
- Fiercely opposed Greek cultural influences
- Authored the first Latin prose history of Rome

### The Gracchi Brothers

Tiberius (163-133 BCE) and Gaius (154-121 BCE) challenged senatorial authority:
- From the noble Sempronian family
- Attempted land redistribution to address growing inequality
- Used the tribunate to bypass Senate opposition
- Both were killed, opening an era of political violence

### Cicero (106-43 BCE)

Rome's greatest orator and prolific writer:
- Rose to prominence as a "new man" (first in family to enter Senate)
- Exposed the Catiline conspiracy in 63 BCE
- Defended traditional republican values
- Left extensive writings that provide insight into senatorial life
- Executed in the proscriptions of the Second Triumvirate

### Cato the Younger (95-46 BCE)

Great-grandson of Cato the Elder and stubborn defender of Senate tradition:
- Known for extreme moral rectitude
- Opposed both Caesar and Pompey
- Would speak until nightfall to prevent votes on matters he opposed
- Committed suicide rather than live under Caesar's rule

## Legislative Powers

The Senate's power evolved substantially over its history:

### Senatus Consultum

The primary expression of the Senate's will:
- Technically only advisory rather than law
- In practice, carried immense moral and political weight
- Magistrates who ignored senatus consulta faced political consequences
- Under the Empire, "*senatus consulta*" became functionally equivalent to laws

### Financial Authority

The Senate controlled the state treasury (*aerarium*):
- Authorized all major state expenditures
- Directed tax collection
- Controlled war funding and military expenses
- Managed the letting of public contracts

### Foreign Policy

The Senate dominated foreign relations:
- Received foreign embassies
- Negotiated and ratified treaties
- Declared war (formally approved by an assembly)
- Assigned provinces to governors
- Determined policy toward subject territories

### Religious Authority

The Senate had significant religious responsibilities:
- Authorized the introduction of new cults and deities
- Interpreted omens and prodigies
- Scheduled religious festivals
- Supervised the state priesthoods
