## Component Documentation

The Roman Senate Game is built with several key components that work together to create an immersive and historically accurate simulation:

- **SenateSession** - The core component orchestrating the complete Senate session flow
- **PresidingOfficials** - Manages the magistrates who preside over Senate sessions
- **Interjections** - Provides dynamic interruptions and reactions during debates
- **PoliticalManeuvering** - Simulates backroom dealings and political favors

## Historical References

The simulation is based on extensive historical research about the Roman Senate circa 100 BCE, including:

- Authentic Senate procedures and protocols
- Historically accurate roles and responsibilities
- Latin terminology and expressions
- Political dynamics of the Late Republic

Refer to the [main documentation](README.md) for detailed explanations of all aspects of the simulation.
