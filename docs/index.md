## Game Modes

The Roman Senate Game offers two main play modes:

### Simulation Mode

Watch AI senators debate and vote on important matters facing Rome. This mode allows you to observe the detailed simulation of Senate proceedings.

```
python -m roman_senate.cli play [options]
```

> **Historical Note:** In the real Roman Senate, meetings often began at dawn and had to end by sunset, as voting after dark was prohibited. Senators sometimes used this rule for filibustering by talking until sunset to prevent a vote!

[Learn more about Simulation Mode](user_guide.md#simulation-mode)

### Interactive Mode

Create your own senator and actively participate in Senate debates and votes. Make speeches, respond to other senators, and influence Roman policy.

```
python -m roman_senate.cli play-as-senator [options]
```

> **Did You Know?** Roman senators wore distinct togas with a broad purple stripe (the "toga praetexta") to signify their rank. When you play in Interactive Mode, imagine yourself donning this distinguished attire!

## Key Features

### Historically Authentic Debates

The game simulates historically authentic debates on topics relevant to the chosen time period. Speeches follow classical Roman oratory structure and include rhetorical devices.

> **Oratorical Insight:** Cicero, Rome's greatest orator, advised dividing speeches into six parts: the introduction (exordium), narration (narratio), division (divisio), proof (confirmatio), refutation (confutatio), and conclusion (peroratio). Our speech generator follows similar classical structure!

### Character Development

In Interactive Mode, develop your senator's influence and relationships with other senators through your speeches and votes.

> **Roman Wisdom:** "Fama volat" - "Reputation flies." Your actions in the Senate will quickly establish your reputation among colleagues.

### Dynamic Political Landscape

Experience the complex political dynamics of the late Roman Republic, with factional politics, personal rivalries, and shifting alliances.

> **Political Insight:** The terms "Optimates" and "Populares" weren't formal parties but political approaches. Optimates ("best men") favored senatorial aristocracy, while Populares ("favoring the people") sought popular support through reforms. Your faction choice affects your political alignment.

### Historical Context Through the Town Crier

Experience Rome's rich history through daily announcements from the town crier, who shares important historical events, anniversaries, and background information relevant to your gameplay session.

> **Historical Note:** Town criers were an important source of news in ancient Rome, where they would make public announcements in forums and other gathering places. Our Story Crier brings this tradition to life with historically accurate announcements.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection (if using OpenAI for speech generation)
- Terminal with rich text support

[See detailed installation instructions](user_guide.md#installation)

## For Developers

If you're interested in understanding, modifying, or extending the game, see the following resources:

- [System Architecture](architecture.md)
- [Package Structure](architecture.md#package-structure)
- [Extension Points](architecture.md#extension-points)
- [Development Workflow](architecture.md#development-workflow)

> **Developer Note:** Just as Rome wasn't built in a day, neither was this codebase. The project has undergone significant refactoring into a proper Python package structure while maintaining the original design principles.
