## Introduction

Interactive Mode (`senate play-as-senator`) allows you to assume the role of a Roman senator, actively participating in Senate debates and votes. Unlike Simulation Mode, where you watch AI senators debate, in Interactive Mode you make speeches, respond to other senators, and cast votes that influence Roman policy.

## Character Creation

When you start Interactive Mode, you'll first create your senator character through a series of choices that determine your starting attributes and political position.

You can restart character creation if you want to make changes.

## Senate Session Gameplay

Once your character is created, you'll participate in a Senate session. Here's what happens:

1. **Attendance and Seating**: You are automatically seated according to your influence rank
2. **Topic Introduction**: Multiple topics are presented for debate
3. **Debate Process**: For each topic, the debate occurs in rounds
4. **Voting**: After debate, all senators (including you) cast votes
5. **Results**: Outcomes are announced and your status is updated

### The Player's Turn

During debates, you'll have several opportunities to participate:

1. **Opening speech**: In the first round, you'll be asked if you want to speak
2. **Interjections**: You can interject during other senators' speeches
3. **Additional speeches**: In later rounds, you can choose to speak again
4. **Voting**: Cast your vote on each topic after debate concludes

## Making Speeches

When it's your turn to speak, you'll be prompted to choose your stance on the topic:

- **Support**: Argue in favor of the proposal
- **Oppose**: Argue against the proposal
- **Neutral**: Take a balanced or conditional position

Your faction will suggest a default position, but you can choose differently. After selecting your stance, you'll be asked to provide the content of your speech.

### Speech Impact

Your speeches influence:
- Other senators' voting decisions
- Your relationships with senators who share or oppose your views
- Your reputation and influence attributes

### Effective Speech Strategies

1. **Address the historical context**: Reference relevant historical events or precedents
2. **Respond to previous speakers**: Acknowledge and address points made by other senators
3. **Appeal to faction interests**: Emphasize aspects that align with your faction's values
4. **Use rhetorical techniques**: Employ questions, emotional appeals, and logical reasoning
5. **Include Latin phrases**: Sprinkle in Latin expressions (with translations) for authenticity

## Interjecting

During another senator's speech, you'll be asked if you want to interject. This allows you to make a brief comment or objection without waiting for your turn to speak.

### Interjection Process

1. You'll see a segment of the current speech
2. You can choose to interject with a brief comment
3. Your interjection becomes part of the debate record
4. It affects your relationship with the speaker

### Strategic Interjections

- **Supporting interjections**: Improve relationships with the speaker
- **Opposing interjections**: May damage relationships but establish your position
- **Factual corrections**: Can enhance your reputation for knowledge
- **Questions**: Can highlight weaknesses in arguments without seeming confrontational

## Voting

After the debate concludes, you'll cast your vote on the topic:

- **Aye**: Support the proposal
- **Nay**: Oppose the proposal
- **Abstain**: Neither support nor oppose

### Voting Consequences

- **Aligned with outcome**: If your vote matches the winning side, you gain influence (+3)
- **Aligned with faction**: Voting with your faction strengthens faction relationships
- **Against faction**: Voting against your faction may damage faction relationships
- **Strategic voting**: Sometimes voting against your speech position can be strategic

## Building Relationships

Throughout the game, your interactions affect your relationships with other senators:

- **Positive relationships**: Senators are more likely to support your position in votes
- **Negative relationships**: Senators may oppose you regardless of the topic

### Relationship Mechanics

Relationships are tracked on a scale from 0-100:
- 0-20: Hostile
- 21-40: Unfriendly
- 41-60: Neutral
- 61-80: Friendly
- 81-100: Allied

### Improving Relationships

- Support a senator's position in your speech
- Make supportive interjections during their speeches
- Vote in alignment with their interests
- Target specific influential senators for relationship building

## Gameplay Tips

### Political Strategy

- **First Session Focus**: Build key relationships rather than winning every vote
- **Know Your Audience**: Tailor arguments to the specific factions present
- **Pick Your Battles**: Focus energy on topics important to your faction or interests
- **Watch Voting Patterns**: Note which senators tend to vote together

### Effective Debating

- **Observe AI Speeches**: Study the rhetorical techniques used by AI senators
- **Balance Emotion and Logic**: Use both emotional appeals and logical reasoning

- **Respond Directly**: Address points made by previous speakers to show engagement
